# Graphs – Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository contains my implementations of **Graph algorithms** while learning Data Structures & Algorithms.

## 📌 What is a Graph?

A **Graph** is a data structure made of:

- **Vertices (Nodes)**
- **Edges (Connections between nodes)**

Graphs are widely used in real-world applications like navigation systems, social networks, and network routing.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Graph Representation (Adjacency List / Matrix)  
- BFS (Breadth First Search)  
- DFS (Depth First Search)  
- Topological Sort  
- Shortest Path Algorithms  
- Minimum Spanning Tree  
- Disjoint Set (Union-Find)

## 🎯 Goal

To strengthen my understanding of graph concepts and improve problem-solving skills for coding interviews.
